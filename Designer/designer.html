                    <p>After fifteen years in the fashion industry, Stephanie shifted her attention to her true
                        passion,
                        interior design. She fearlessly created her own studio, taking on every aspect of a project,
                        from major structural work down to choosing the tiniest spoon, from art collections to
                        custom-made furniture, designer fabrics, and more.</p>
                    <p>“We are a practice that encompasses all aspects of the trade. We are involved in every step
                        of
                        the project, from start to finish, maintaining our high standards throughout,” explains
                        Stephanie. Apartments, villas, penthouses, hotels, spas, restaurants and boutiques: the
                        agency
                        handles international projects of all sizes. </p>

                        designs daringly
                        elegant interiors combining the decorative arts with a blend of cultures—her way of
                        affirming
                        her idea of French luxury, an art of living that is all about elegance. </p>

                    <p>Everything serves as inspiration, everything she encounters in contemporary art fairs, magazines,
                        exhibitions, or during her travels. Her tastes are eclectic. She favours a variety of artists,
                        capable of appreciating the London underground scene as much as the FIAC International
                        Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. “I have fun, it’s my recreation time,” she states. “When I go to
                        the flea market, I’m not just window shopping. I buy things I like, without knowing where I’ll
                        put them but with the conviction that they will someday find a place.”</p>
                    <p>SC Édition has grown to become an internationally renowned laboratory of ideas, a pillar of the
                        hyper- luxury interior design community. Clients from the world over flock to their doors to
                        find original creative proposals. Stephanie does not follow trends, she makes them.</p>
                    <p>Like an Haute Couture house, the agency sets itself apart by its artistic talent, custom-made
                        creations, and a deep understanding of the clients’ needs</p>
                </div>
                <div class="w-50 d-flex flex-column align-items-center">
                    <p>“Some clients don’t know what they like, so I listen closely and build their ideal universe,”
                        reveals Stephanie. A universe filled with unique objects imagined, designed, and produced by the
                        agency.</p>
                    <p>Stephanie produces high-quality furniture and decorative objects in collaboration with some of
                        the greatest names: Baccarat, Promemoria, Taï Ping, THG Paris, and others. The interior
                        designer has an exceptionally keen ability to listen, but she also has a sixth sense, an
                        intuition that guides her. “When I look at a place, I ask myself if I would be happy living
                        there,” she adds. And then follows through with the skilful execution of her project. The agency
                        cultivates the French art de vivre. Her passionate collaboration with renowned artists and
                        talented artisans is the essence of her style.</p>
                    <p>For Stephanie Coutas, the ultimate satisfaction and reward is to see her clients walk into a
                        space that she has transformed and watch their faces light up with wonder, oblivious to the
                        hours of work that went into a project. She never forgets to thank them for their trust and the
                        human adventure that they have shared, desiring nothing more than to continue developing the
                        most beautiful projects for them.</p>
